First SASS exercise color-1
===========================

The first exercise arranges 7 `div` elements to a rocket shape, through a hand
of declared and modifiable variables, partly depending on each other.

The changeable variables are:
----------------------------- 

`$width` - defines the width of the elements 
`$height` - defines the height of the elements 
`$spacing` - defines the vertical distance between the elements depending on the height
`$offset` - defines the offset of the elements depending on the width
